# Funnels

Welcome to my project for Funnels. In this project, I have used funnel analysis to identify where customers drop off in their journey.

## Repository Content
- `M3S2Cleardata.sql`: SQL query to clear data and remove duplicates, leaving one event for each action.
- `TOP3countries.sql`: SQL query to identify the top three countries by event quantity.
- `Clear_TOP_3Countries_information.sql`: SQL query to collect clear information for the top three countries.
- `FunnelTOP3.sql`: SQL query to create a table for funnel analysis.
- `Funnel_for_category.sql`: Additional query to check one of the possible impacts on why people drop off.

## Purpose
The analysis was conducted to understand and compare the top three countries and identify steps in the customer journey where the company loses customers. This is aimed at pinpointing areas for further analysis and requiring additional attention.

## Research Findings
1. When analyzing the funnel in the top three countries by event quantity, we noticed the most significant drop between the first visit and scrolling, a common trend across cases.
The second notable drop occurs between scrolling and viewing specific items, indicating that although people search for products on our website, they don't explore many of them. This suggests a potential lack of variety in our offerings or issues with the attractiveness and informativeness of our titles and photos. This step warrants attention in our customer touchpoint map. in our customer touchpoint map.

2. Another crucial focus area is the "add to cart" step, where there's a significant drop-off after customers examine an item but choose not to purchase it. This suggests a need to reassess pricing and compare it with competitors. Additionally, we should review the clarity of our product descriptions and consider the ease of navigation, especially regarding differences between mobile and desktop experiences or browser compatibility issues.

3. Encouragingly, there's a minimal drop after customers add payment information and proceed to the purchase phase. This indicates that once customers decide to buy a product and provide payment details, they tend to complete the transaction.

## Additional Research and Results
1. After additional analyse to see if there are any differences between desktop and mobile funnels we can see they are similar but when we look at the drop of percantage after all event in mobile there a 1.77 % from start qty. That means that people buys more with their phones.
